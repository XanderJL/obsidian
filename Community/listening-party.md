# The Party Corgi Listening Party

The `#listening-party` channel is meant to be a place to share what you're listening to throughout your workday, while you stream, etc. Think of it as user-submitted radio.

## The How-To

So, you want to share what you've been listening to with the Corgis. ![Party Corgi](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/634652211493732360.gif?v=1) 

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**This guide will make two assumptions**:

1. You have a [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/premium/?utm_source=ca-en_brand_contextual_text&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_ca_premiumbusiness_premium_brand+contextual+text+exact+ca-en+google&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsuP5BRCoARIsAPtX_wEFLpe0dw0FLdN3lA36GWWz0Q8oUQD_Fi8j7bXI3xJqwKnCO_yujMsaAuKXEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) account.
2. You're using Discord and Spotify in tandem on a desktop.

### Let's get connected

If you're listening to Spotify, Discord will see that and you'll be prompted with this little call to action. 

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

![Browser confirmation on connection](https://i.imgur.com/u3pfCLo.jpg) 

Clicking the connect button will bring up a browser window with a login screen, after logging in, you should be met with this. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

You can confirm you're connected by visiting the `Connections` tab under `User Settings` in Discord.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**Congrats**! You're able to move onto the next step.

![Green play button in the text input field](https://i.imgur.com/uKqBZLO.jpg) 

To get started, have something playing in your Spotify desktop app. Now, in the `#listening-party` channel, you should see a green play arrow on the `+` button to the left of the text input box. 

If the green play arrow does not appear, make sure your Discord status is set to `Online`.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

![Invite #channel to listen to Spotify](https://i.imgur.com/vlmj5QI.jpg) 

In the pop up, you should see "Invite `#channel-name` to Listen to Spotify". Once you click that, it should post a share link to that channel. It should look something like... 

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

![Success! You're sharing your music with the homies](https://i.imgur.com/c59opKL.png) 

This! Congrats. You're sharing your tunes with the homies.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

![You can see who is streaming their music in a voice channel by hovering your cursor over it](https://i.imgur.com/hnLfDhV.jpg) 

Another little nice-to-have, is this; the pop up when you hover over a voice channel. This will lead into some ideas I have for the [roadmap](#the-roadmap) of the channel.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**Please post your playlist while streaming so that those who don't pay for Premium can follow along in some capacity!**

## The Roadmap

So I have a few ideas for the channel moving forward, but I'd like input from all of you!

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

In no particular order:

- A weekly book club-style listening party Friday/Saturday evenings. We'd have a poll to pick an album to listen to throughout the week and have a discussion about it in `#voice-03`. The goal here is to broaden our horizons on our perceptions of genres (read: Opera, Country, etc.). I have yet to work out all of the logistics here, so feedback would be greatly appreciated!
- A monthly online 'concert'. I imagine there are many among us who are both musically and technically inclined. I'd love to allow for the community to perform/show off what they've been working on! If there's enough interest, I'd love to try and get this organized.
- Build a bot that would auto-pin the most recently shared `Spotify Invite` to the channel. (I have literally zero experience with this and would love a hand!).

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

That's all for now, folks! Please feel free to shoot me a DM in Discord or fire off an [e-mail](mailto:me@alexlow.dev) with ideas, concerns, or a fresh-to-death playlist!

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

Xoxo,
